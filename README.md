# XarigamiND TinyMCE


XarTinyMCE is based on TinyMCE (a very old version), a platform independent, web based Javascript HTML WYSIWYG 
editor released as Open Source under LGPL by Moxiecode Systems AB

xarTinyMCE has a number of nice features such as browser support for all modern browsers 
(currently Mozilla, MSIE, FireFox, Opera and Safari) and support for XHTML 1.0 strict markup. 
There are powerful features for not only specifying which xhtml tags are allowed, but also which
attributes and attribute values. You can enhance xarTinyMCE further with plugins and different configuration settings.
